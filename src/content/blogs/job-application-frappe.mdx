## I. What are you passionate about?

> Systems, Processes & Tech (chronologically)

These are the 3 domains where most of my life has been invested in. 

During my childhood, I used to wonder - how does a company manages to: build, produce, and serve to millions of customers without going insane?

The answer was **Systems**, and it took me 20 years to figure that out (i am 21 y/o). 

**Here's my story about how I spent those twenty years (which made me who I am today) & how my experiences can help me contribute to Frappe.**

### Getting into Raghav's Childhood

It always fascinated me how my dad used to do business (yes, I come from a family business background, just like Rushabh!)

I used to see him - starting his day by calling our factory supervisor & get updates, their would be exchange of words, words that I couldn't make sense of, but during those exchange of words, sometimes there would be anger, frustration & chaos; things that I could make sense of (because it doesn't require business logic to understand emotions at such tender age)
